# Welcome to Flow State
Flow State is a streaming money platform and digital cooperative. 

We believe that streams are the ultimate form of programmable moneyâ€”real-time, dynamic, & composable. We build tools so that every web3 builder, team, DAO, and community can leverage their superpowers. This includes streaming grant strategies (Streaming Quadratic Funding), simplified team stream management (Flow Splitters), continuous ecosystem builder programs (Flow Councils), and more.

We are structured as a Colorado Limited Cooperative. This means we are democratically governed and have unique opportunities to design incentive-aligned (onchain) profit distribution mechanisms across multiple stakeholder classes.
