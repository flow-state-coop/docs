# Octant Accelerator SQF

:::tip[Participate in the Round]
TL;DR: Go to [https://flowstate.network/octant](https://flowstate.network/octant) to support your favorite public goods builders from the Octant Accelerator with 15+ ETH in real-time matching funds.
:::

## Motivation

The Octant Accelerator was launched to help web3 builders achieve **project sustainability**:

But, the 4-week crash course isn’t the end of Octant’s investment in these builders. 

In partnership with Flow State & Superfluid, Octant is sponsoring a 15 ETH (and growing) Streaming Quadratic Funding (SQF) round exclusively for accelerator graduates. 

## Round Basics

- Start Date - October 24, 2024 (Accelerator Demo Day)
- End Date - January 1, 2025 (with the potential to be extended)
- Network - Base
- Matching - 15 ETHx starting pool
- Direct Donations - ETHx denominated
- Voter Eligibility - Soulbound NFT
- Donation UI Link - [https://flowstate.network/octant](https://flowstate.network/octant)

The 15 ETH+ matching pool will be continuously streamed to grantees over 69 days based on a dynamic implementation of the [quadratic funding formula](https://www.wtfisqf.com/?grant=&grant=&grant=&grant=&match=1000).  Every new, updated, and closed direct donation stream will update the funding allocation weights in real-time. 

### Octant Matching Stream Schedule

Octant will stream its 15 ETH through the matching pool according to the following schedule. Individual and group matching funders can open their variable rate streams to the round (i.e. “Grow the Pie”) anytime from the [round UI](https://flowstate.network/octant)!

| Week | Start Date | Rate (ETHx/mo) | Weekly Allocation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | October 24 | 2 | 0.5 |
| 2 | October 31 | 2 | 0.5 |

## Voter Eligibility

The Octant Accelerator SQF round will use a non-transferrable NFT to determine donor-matching eligibility. 

We airdropped this [Voter NFT](https://basescan.org/address/0xAd424D55ffd23E80B222aA67138370A21c0a0b24) to Octant community members and registered attendees of the Accelerator Demo Day before the start of the round. 

Others interested in participating can get their voter badge by [earning a role in the Octant SQF Guild](https://guild.xyz/octant-sqf-voter) and claiming the NFT at checkout on the [SQF Round UI](https://flowstate.network/octant). We’ll add and adjust Guild roles in throughout the round to *responsibly* maximize participation. If you’re not a bot and you can’t seem to find a path to earn your Voter NFT in Guild, join the [Flow State Telegram](https://t.me/flowstatecoop) and we can figure out a manual Sybil-check process for you.
