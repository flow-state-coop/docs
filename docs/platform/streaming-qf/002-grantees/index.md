# Grantees

## Create a Project

Streaming Quadratic Funding (SQF) is a [Gitcoin Allo Protocol](https://allo.gitcoin.co/) [Strategy](https://docs.allo.gitcoin.co/strategies). It leverages the [Allo Project Registry](https://docs.allo.gitcoin.co/registry) to manage funding recipient applications and project information.

To receive funding in an SQF round, grantees must first create an Allo project. If you’ve previously participated in a Gitcoin Grants round, you can reuse an existing project—in fact, it's recommended! Accumulating grant history in the Registry is a great way to build trust in your project. 

Flow State has added several metadata fields to Gitcoin’s standard project setup and recommends lower image file sizes (for use in Farcaster Frames), so it’s always worth reviewing your project before submitting a new pool application.

You can utilize [basic Markdown syntax](002-project-markdown.md) in your Project Description to better organize your information.

Even if you haven’t found an SQF pool to apply for, you can create a project and start sharing your Flow State project home page to attract direct donation streams. Think of this page like your web3 Patreon page.

## Apply for a Round

Each SQF round has a unique application link. Some applications may be public and linked via the Flow State home page. Other rounds may be invite-only based on operator preferences.

Once you’ve navigated to the application page and signed in with your project wallet, you can apply in as few as three clicks:

- Select the project with which you want to apply
    - Optional: update your project details as needed
- Click `Apply` at the bottom of the page
- Sign the transaction

Project information cannot be updated after an SQF round application is submitted. Make your updates before applying!

The round operators will review your application onchain. You can check the status of your application by returning to this page. If accepted, you gain access to the [Grantee Tools](001-tools.md) tab to help manage and grow your grant.

Pay attention to any specific round criteria, focus, or application requirements before applying to rounds to save your and the round operators’ time. You can only apply **once per project per round**. Only **one project per grantee address** can be accepted to the pool.

## During the Round

Once your application is accepted, you’ll be added to the round’s donation UI. 

Round operators will initiate a matching stream and the SQF round will start per their schedule. Operators may increase or decrease the matching stream rate throughout the round. 

Like traditional QF, the more donors that support your project, the higher the relative SQF matching multiplier. But, the SQF donor dynamic differs from traditional QF because of SQF’s continuous donation stream model. 

Traditional QF rounds can be dominated by low-conviction, one-off donations: donors airdrop hunting or choosing what’s already popular. Maintaining a donation stream requires a different mindset. 

Success in SQF rounds is not about groveling to acquaintances to “just donate a dollar” every quarter or shouting into the social media void hoping to catch a flier. The bar for continuous support is higher—healthier. Grantees who focus on consistently demonstrating impact and growing a real community/user base will reap the rewards. 

There’s a reason traditional non-profits focus on recurring donations, and the SaaS business model is so powerful. Recurring (and even better in SQF, continuous) revenue is a stronger, more sustainable foundation to grow, innovate, and deliver value. It aligns the interests of money sender-recipient for the long-term—not just to make a “sale.”

So, continuous donations are an *investment* in the future and a consistent demonstration of impact. Your approach to growing your supporter base in SQF should center on that fact.
