# Grantee Tools

Once you’ve been accepted to an SQF round, there are several round-specific tools available to help manage and grow your grant. 

The Grantee Tools page is accessible via the “Active Grants” section of your project’s home page or at the unique link used to apply to the round.

## Connect to Pool

You must complete a one-time transaction to connect to each round’s matching pool smart contract.  This transaction allows your streaming token balance to update in real-time via the [Superfluid protocol](https://docs.superfluid.finance/docs/concepts/superfluid). Don’t worry—your funds are still safe before you complete this action. 

To complete the action, simply click the `Connect to Pool` button on the Grantee Tools page and sign the transaction.

## Direct Donation Link

Share the auto-generated link for users to jump to checkout for your grant on the donation UI. Use this link in your social posts, newsletters, & community chats to drive more donations.

## Farcaster Frame Link

One of the coolest things about SQF is that the matching multiplier is *real—*not an inevitably incomplete estimate like in traditional QF. When a donor opens an SQF support stream, the impact on matching is immediate. 

We built a Farcaster Frame for you to capitalize on this and attract more supporters. All you need to do is share your unique project+pool link in a Farcaster post. The Frame will render with your project name, profile picture, and description and allow users to check the real-time matching multiplier for your grant at ascending donation levels. 

## View Pool Stats

For more details on your round’s matching pool including cumulative distributions, current allocation breakdown, and user transactions, check out the [Superfluid Explorer](https://explorer.superfluid.finance/). The `View Pool Stats` button navigates you directly to the pool page.

## Superfluid Wallet Tools

The [Superfluid App](https://app.superfluid.finance/) offers additional tools to manage your [Super Token](https://docs.superfluid.finance/docs/concepts/overview/super-tokens) balances (i.e. the tokens streamed to you in SQF direct and matching streams). Wrap/unwrap, stream, and bridge tokens from the app.
