# Project Markdown

We get it. Your project is doing a lot, and you need a better way than a wall of text to deliver your Project Description. 

That’s why we support [***basic Markdown syntax***](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) across Flow State wherever your full project description is displayed. 

We recommend using a [Markdown preview tool](https://markdownlivepreview.com/) when drafting your description. 

You can edit your main project description anytime, but after you’ve been accepted to a round you may be locked into that description (depending on the round configuration). This is to prevent “bait & switch” round applications.

# Flow State Markdown Syntax Guide

## Headers

# This is a Heading h1 

## This is a Heading h2 

###### This is a Heading h6 

## Line Breaks

*To create a line break or new line, end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return. Add an extra return to create a new paragraph. (Note: we do not support the HTML <br> syntax as a substitute.)*

This is the first line.  

And this is the second line.  

This is a new paragraph.
