# Project Markdown

We get it. Your project is doing a lot, and you need a better way than a wall of text to deliver your Project Description. 

That’s why we support [***basic Markdown syntax***](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) across Flow State wherever your full project description is displayed. 

We recommend using a [Markdown preview tool](https://markdownlivepreview.com/) when drafting your description. 

You can edit your main project description anytime, but after you’ve been accepted to a round you may be locked into that description (depending on the round configuration). This is to prevent “bait & switch” round applications.
