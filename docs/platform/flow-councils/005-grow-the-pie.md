# Grow The Pie
Flow Councils aren't just for fixed budgets: anyone can permissionlessly **Grow the Pie** by streaming additional tokens into the Council's distribution pool.

1. **Open a stream.** In the header of any Flow Council, click the `Grow the Pie` button. Follow the checkout flow to open/edit your stream (including [wrapping a Super Token](https://docs.superfluid.org/docs/concepts/overview/super-tokens#wrapper-super-tokens), if necessary).
2. **Keep a balance.** Ensure your wallet maintains a positive token balance so the stream stays active.  
3. **Stop whenever you like.** There is no fixed end date for Flow Councils. It's up to you when you close your stream.
