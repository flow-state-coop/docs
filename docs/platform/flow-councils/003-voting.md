# Voting

Flow Councils are dynamic. They empower voters to incorporate new information and evolving preferences for more efficient resource allocation.

Every time a vote is (re)cast, funding flows will adapt.

`payout_rate = (recipient votes / total votes) Ã— funding stream`

Council votes are cast in ballots. Council Members review grantee information, add their favorites to a ballot, allocate whole votes (up to their voting budgets and spread max), and then submit with a single transaction. Voters can edit and recast their ballot anytime.

For many rounds, we'll sponsor network transaction fees. While SQF uses out-of-pocket spending as *the signal* for preference, Flow Councils are designed to be maximally accessible both conceptually and financially.
