# Flow Councils
**_Continuous, participatory funding allocation._**

## Overview
**Flow Councils** are a tool for continuous, participatory funding allocation. **Council Members** vote to split a stream of money across an arbitrary number of recipients. 

Flow Councils enable real-time (re)allocation of budgets based on new information, evolving priorities, and demonstrated results. The streaming structure offers adaptability and efficiency for allocators; for recipients, capital velocity and budget predictability.

Flow Councils are a great tool for grants programs, organizational budgeting, and any collective allocation process to become more dynamic and effective.

In June, we'll be releasing a no-code launchpad for Flow Councils. In the meantime, reach out to us on [Telegram](https://t.me/flowstatecoop) if you're interested in being one of the first Flow Council users.
