# Flow Splitters
**_The easiest way to dynamically stream tokens to your team, guild, DAO, or community._**

## Overview
Flow Splitters are (onchain & offchain) enhanced [Superfluid distribution pools](https://docs.superfluid.finance/docs/concepts/overview/distributions).

They enable scalable one-to-many token distributions onchain. With distribution pools, a money stream or token transfer can be proportionally split to an arbitrary number of recipients based on the shares each holds.

Settlement is passive and gasless–-meaning payouts don’t need to be periodically processed or manually withdrawn from the pool by recipients. Once their shares are connected with a single transaction, recipients receive their distributions in real-time.

Flow Splitters make this powerful onchain primitive accessible through a no-code interface and tooling to encourage more dynamic, creative, and effective pool management.

Streams are the ultimate form of programmable money. We want more teams, guilds, DAOs, and communities to be able to tap into their power. [Give us a shout if you have feedback or ideas](https://t.me/flowstatecoop).
