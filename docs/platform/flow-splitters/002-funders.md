# Funders

## Distribute & Visualize

Each Flow Splitter launched on Flow State has its own publicly accessible “home page.”

More features will be coming to this page soon (see Roadmap), but for now, it’s good for visualizing your Flow Splitter money flows and opening new ones.

You can navigate to any Flow Splitters you’re part of [https://flowstate.network/flow-splitters](https://flowstate.network/flow-splitters).

The \`Open Flow\` button provides a guided checkout process for opening a streaming distribution to the Flow Splitter. Set the rate you want to stream, (optionally) wrap an ERC20 token into the Super Token format for streaming, and submit.

We’ve included a simple line graph at checkout to demonstrate the impact of your transactions on your Super Token balance.
