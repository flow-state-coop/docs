# Use Cases

## Restreaming Grants/Salaries

Optimism’s Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF) program streams its grant awards to recipients using Superfluid. Rather than periodically unwrapping the OPx Super Token to OP and batch processing payments, why not restream the grant in real-time?

Flow Splitters make it easy to set relative allocation splits and start/adjust/stop a single payment stream for your whole team. It saves administration time and makes your grant more impactful by getting your contributors paid faster.

## Attracting External Funding

Once your team’s allocation weights are onchain in a distribution pool, _anyone_ can start funding you with a stream. The onchain split provides funders transparency and satisfaction that their support is routed to individual contributors and initiatives in real time. Public goods funding can evolve from uncertain, lumpy support to more predictable and continuous.

Think of it like the [Protocol Guild](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) model of attracting funding but implemented with real-time money streams.

## Streaming Programmatic Rewards

Flow Splitters make updating stream allocations at scale simple. DAOs and communities can experiment with different (offchain) point systems, regularly update the shares in their Flow Splitter, and provide responsive, continuous rewards to the people/activities that drive value in their ecosystems.

## Memeing (Str-meme-ing?)

Flow Splitter shares are ERC20 tokens. You can give them a token name & ticker. They’ll display across wallets and block explorers like other tokens… but they’re not just like other tokens. They have built-in onchain distribution superpowers.

The design space is wide open to experiment with mechanics that stream points, companion tokens, dividends, etc. to token holders. Hey, the next big memecoin meta may be _memeshares_.
