# What is the Flow State Cooperative?

**Flow State Coop** is a community-driven organization that supports the development and growth of the public goods economy. By becoming a member, you can **earn Patronage dividends** based on the coop’s net profits for your contributions to public goods and the Flow State platform.

## **Understanding Coop Patronage**
:::warning[Flow State Coop is Actively Under Development]
The information below is provided to share the vision and create a framework for Flow State Coop. Details will change as we roll it out.
:::

Our patronage system is designed to **recognize and reward members** for their value-add activities made to the public good. It's implemented as a two-step process:

1. **Recognition** 
2. **Redemption**

Let's explore each step in detail.

### 1. Recognition: Earning Public Goods Cred

**Public Goods Cred** are tokens used to publicly account for contributions to the public good. Think of them as a way the cooperative says, "We see your efforts and want others to see them too!"

#### How You Earn Public Goods Cred

There are different classes of coop membership, each with specific activities that we can trace impact to the public good:

| **Membership Class** | **Who They Are** | **How They Earn Public Goods Cred** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Class A - Funders** | Members who stream funding to projects. | Contributions to matching pools & grantees |
| **Class B - Builders** | Members contributing to public goods while funded through Flow State. | Receiving funding for their work |
| **Class C - Contributors** | Members who contribute labor directly to the cooperative (developers, designers, etc.). | Contributing to code repositories; Completing designs or managing projects; Writing documentation; Onboarding new members |
| **Class D - Holons** | Projects or communities using Flow State to manage their resources. | Utilizing Flow State for funding allocation; Paying for platform usage |

#### Key Features of Public Goods Cred

- **Real-Time Recognition:** Creds can be earned continuously as you contribute.
- **Transparency**: Implemented as blockchain-based tokens for openness and accessibility.
- **Transferable**: These points can be transferred between members.

**Important:** While Public Goods Creds recognize your contributions, they **do not** directly entitle you to patronage dividends (i.e. coop profit distributions). For that, you need to redeem them!

### 2. Redemption: Converting Cred to Flow State Distribution Units

To participate in patronage dividends (actual cash returns), you need to **redeem your Public Goods Cred** for **Flow State Distribution Units**.

#### How Redemption Works

- **Eligibility**: Only members of the cooperative can redeem Cred.
- **Process**:
    1. **Redeem Coop Points**: Exchange your Creds for Distribution Units at a ratio determined by the cooperative's policies.
    2. **Non-Transferable Units**: Distribution Units are recorded on the blockchain but cannot be transferred to others.
        - The exchange rate between Cred and Distribution Units may be updated time to time by the cooperative's board.

#### Why Redeem?

- **Access to Dividends**: Only Distribution Units (not Cred) count towards the apportionment of patronage dividends.
- **Participation**: Engage more deeply with the cooperative's success.

### An Example to Illustrate the Recognition + Redemption Process

Let's make this concrete with an example:

#### Scenario

- The cooperative has **$10,000** in net margins to distribute as patronage dividends.
- The board has set the redemption ratios:
    - **Funder Cred**: Redeem at **2:1** (2 Creds for 1 Distribution Unit).
    - **Builder Cred**: Redeem at **1:1**.

#### Members

|  | **Member A** | **Member B** | **Non-Member C** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Funder Cred** | 50 (**10 redeemed**) | 50 (**50 redeemed**) | 1,000 (**0 redeemed**) |
| **Builder Cred** | 100 (**70 redeemed**) | 0 (**0 redeemed**) | 10 (**0 redeemed**) |
| **Total Distribution Units** | **75 units** | **25 units** | **0 units** |

### **Calculating Distribution Units**

- **Member A**:
    - **Funder**: 10 Cred ÷ 2 = 5 Units
    - **Builder**: 70 Cred ÷ 1 = 70 Units
    - **Total Units**: 5 + 70 = **75 Units**
- **Member B**:
    - **Funder**: 50 Cred ÷ 2 = 25 Units
    - **Total**: **25 Units**

### **Dividend Distribution**

- **Total Units Redeemed**: 75 (Member A) + 25 (Member B) = **100 units**
- **Dividend Per Unit**: $10,000 ÷ 100 units = **$100 per unit**

| **Member** | **Units** | **Dividend Received** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Member A** | 7 | 75 units × $100 = **$7,500** |
| **Member B** | 25 | 25 units × $100 = **$2,500** |
| **Non-Member C** | 0 | **$0** (not a member, no redeemed Cred) |

**Key Takeaways:**

- Only **redeemed Creds** count towards dividends.
- **Non-members**, even if they have Creds, **do not receive dividends**.
- The amount of money you receive is **proportional to your Distribution Units**.

## Membership Classes and Activities

Here's a summary of the membership classes and how they participate:

### Summary Table

| **Class** | **Who They Are** | **Patronage Activities** | **Patronage Distribution Mechanisms** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Class A - Funders** | Members who stream funding to projects. | Contributions to matching pools & grantees | Return stream of Cred tokens as long as the funding stream is open; Other Superfluid mechanisms |
| **Class B - Builders** | Members contributing to public goods while funded through Flow State. | Receiving funding through Flow State | Streaming matching; Direct allocation of Cred |
| **Class C - Contributors** | Members contributing labor to the cooperative or platform. | Contributing to code; Completing designs; Managing projects; Onboarding | Peer evaluation (e.g., Coordinape), Guild streams, Contribution weighting |
| **Class D - Holons** | Projects or communities using Flow State to allocate resources. | Using Flow State for funding allocation, Paying for platform usage | Percentage of the community's Flow State volume, Retroactive patronage |

### Technical and Legal Considerations

- **Two-Tier System**: Separating recognition (earning Cred) from redemption (converting Cred to Distribution Units) helps maintain flexibility and ensures compliance with legal requirements.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Using blockchain technology for tokens and units promotes transparency and efficiency.
- **Governance**: The cooperative's board sets policies, including redemption ratios and eligibility criteria.
- **Membership Changes**:
    - **Inactive Members**: If a member becomes inactive or leaves, their Patronage Units are removed from the active ledger (after distributing any pending dividends).
    - **Returning Members**: If they return, their units can be reinstated.

## **Key Points to Remember**

- **Membership Matters**: Only cooperative members can redeem Cred and receive dividends.
- **Active Participation**: Stay engaged to maximize your benefits.
- **Redeeming Points**: Don't forget to redeem your Public Goods Cred if you want to participate in dividend distributions.
- **Governance Participation**: As a member, you may have a say in cooperative decisions, including how points are allocated and redeemed.
